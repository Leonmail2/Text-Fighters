# Text Fighters!

Text Fighters is a text-based local multi player strategic fighting game played with a turn based combat system.

You can choose from three classes and three perks to give you an edge against your opponent. 

Turn based combat allows for advanced strategy and tactical moves.

# Building

Build with the commands below on unix based operating systems.

```shell
make
./text_fighters
```
or

```shell
make run
```

If you're on windows, please switch to Linux before downloading because windows sucks for development and is terrible for everything except gaming.

## Possible Updates in the Future

1. Implementing a multi player system over the Internet.
2. Adding a score board and matchmaking over the Internet.
3. Expanding the range of characters.
