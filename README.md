# Text Fighters!

Text Fighters is a text-based local multi player strategic fighting game played with a turn based combat system.

You can choose from three classes and three perks to give you an edge against your opponent. 

Turn based combat allows for advanced strategy and tactical moves.

## Playing the Game

Each class has two unique attacks. 

The Mage has fireball and staff. The fireball is a long range weapon that is useful for when your opponent is far away.
The staff is useful when your enemies try to approch you. The Mage is medium range.

The Knight has a sword and a lance. The sword is used to smite your opponent at close range. The lance is longer range, 
and does less damage than the sword. Both of the knights attacks are relativly short range.

The Archer posseses a mighty bow and a dagger. The bow has the longest range, and is effective to pick off your enemies
from a distance. The dagger is great for backstabbing at close range.
